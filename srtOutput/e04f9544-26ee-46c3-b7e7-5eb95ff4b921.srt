1
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:20,949
your surface infiltration measurements and the implications for artificial recharge

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,149
. Here's a picture near the study area looking east

3
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:30,160
in the morning of Ah, this town 29 palms

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,119
is just east of Joshua Tree, um, and

5
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,960
discuss the purpose and scope of the study. The

6
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:43,109
main issue out there was a decrease in water levels

7
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,619
. Teoh increased pumping from increased population they had lost

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,969
. There was decreases of the water table by as

9
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,270
much as 35 feet 50 years. So the purpose

10
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,469
was to evaluate the potential for infiltration through surface deposits

11
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,399
at proposed recharge sites near Joshua Tree, California.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,299
Scope of the study included Field data collection by using

13
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:10,750
a double ring in full trauma, ter um,

14
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,189
and collection of sir official material through Cory. Laboratory

15
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:21,079
Analysis of this official deposits calculation of sir official infiltration

16
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,450
rates from the infill trauma, her data and then

17
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,450
obtaining soil water parameters using computer program. Rosetta.

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,040
An interpretation of the data using the modeling program BS

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,209
two D, which is a unsaturated zone flow model

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,659
. So in outline of this talk, we're going

21
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:44,659
to discuss the study area, talk about how the

22
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:49,159
data that was collected parameter estimation and then modeling with

23
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:55,849
Viets to D and then discuss the conclusions. Um

24
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,489
, study area is about 120 miles east of Los

25
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:04,739
Angeles, California um, centered around the town of

26
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:07,459
Joshua Tree, California We've got 29 palms to the

27
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:12,949
east Yucca Valley to the west, and we've got

28
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:15,629
our major regional groundwater, so obeisance colored here we

29
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:20,539
have the Copper Mountain Groundwater sub basin. The warn

30
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,180
groundwater. So based in 29 palms groundwater, so

31
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,560
basin and then the groundwater. So based on that

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,789
, were mainly concerned with which is the Joshua Tree

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,569
groundwater. So basin recharge into the sub basin.

34
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,819
This either through flow across the yucca barrier here,

35
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,229
which is a series of faults and also recharged through

36
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:46,050
this inter minute quail wash, which flows due to

37
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,360
precipitation. Here in the little certain San Bernadino mountains

38
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:53,870
flow through the crowd wash, eventually closing the Yucca

39
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:00,270
Wash and it flows high enough can reach dry lake

40
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,810
bed of Coyote Lake. A significant feature in this

41
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,900
area is this black line here, which is the

42
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:08,740
Pinto Mountain fault, and it's a barrier to flow

43
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:14,229
between the Joshua Tree Groundwater sub basin and the Copper

44
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:22,189
Mountain groundwater. So busy this map Here is ah

45
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:23,780
, zoomed in detailed map of the study area.

46
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:29,490
We have the Pinter Mountain fault crossing from the south

47
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,909
west to the Northeast across map, and we have

48
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:36,479
two different proposed areas for recharge we have north of

49
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,229
the Penta Mountain Fault. This area here is the

50
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:45,680
ICA Wash on these two painful trauma test sites are

51
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,039
just on the fringe of the wash. Water recharged

52
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:51,530
north of the pent amount fall would be constrained,

53
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,810
contained by the fault and therefore would be more of

54
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:00,180
a water bank storage type situation. Water infiltrated south

55
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,159
of the fault, Um, would be more of

56
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:12,490
, ah, recharge of the aquifer system. So

57
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,069
data was collected had those info traumatize sites he saw

58
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,689
in the previous map. This here is a double

59
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,170
ring in full trauma. Ter. We seated this

60
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,560
into the ground as far as possible without disturbing too

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,069
much of the surface Shal material, um, and

62
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:27,870
then burn the edges to prevent leaking from outside edges

63
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,600
of the inflow trauma. Ter Each ring. These

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,290
are two separate rings here. Each ring is connected

65
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:39,449
to its own calibrated reservoir reservoirs calibrated a five gallon

66
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:43,990
intervals. Um, and testing is done by filling

67
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,850
the two rings to desired stage height so that they

68
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,399
were both equal and then regulating flow from the the

69
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,579
reservoirs into the rings to keep the stage height equal

70
00:04:55,579 --> 00:05:00,170
throughout the testing. Therefore, the water removed from

71
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,269
the reservoir can be assumed to be the water infiltrated

72
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,250
through that ring. Uh, set up for this

73
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,209
ring is special in that we're trying to measure strictly

74
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:16,410
downward flow of water so the outside ring can flow

75
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,550
down there. But it can also flow laterally away

76
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,160
from the ring. But it also constrains the flow

77
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,680
of the entering so that flowed. Entering it should

78
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,269
be strictly downward movement. So the rate from the

79
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:33,699
entering would be your downward rave movement of water through

80
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:38,069
that that ring. And then this just shows this

81
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,180
set up and the study areas, you can get

82
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,550
a feel for the scenario. We're working it.

83
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,560
Here's the data that we God from doing the inflow

84
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,019
trauma tests. We have our three different scenarios of

85
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:59,259
settings In the study area. We have washed near

86
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,680
Washington on wash settings. You can see that are

87
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,050
wash provided the highest infiltration rates. We've got volume

88
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,569
her time. So we've got a greater on slope

89
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,089
here, which means a higher infiltration rate. You

90
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,120
can see that it it's less for the near wash

91
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:19,029
settings and further, more or less in the non

92
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:23,639
wash settings. One interesting thing to point out is

93
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,100
you can see with near wash and wash settings.

94
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,879
We have a very linen, your data you would

95
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,569
expect for infiltration that with the beginning, when infiltration

96
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:39,170
commences that you would have not only gravitational forces but

97
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,560
also matric potential forces. And as the water moved

98
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,769
further down in the subsurface, the gravitational forces would

99
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,490
predominate and the infiltration rate would decrease. You can

100
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,889
kind of see that here for our non wash setting

101
00:06:54,889 --> 00:07:00,029
, you've got a slight exponential decrease on infiltration rate

102
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:03,990
with time and a believe that the reason you don't

103
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,860
see that for the near washing wash settings is the

104
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,019
men for cooperation rate is so high that you you

105
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:14,970
do not see that the exponential decrease and linearity is

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,740
reached very early on, uh, to prove her

107
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,439
toe kind of back. This point up, this

108
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,160
is in full trauma. Her data from a study

109
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,629
done an Antelope Valley where we had very low infiltration

110
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:30,829
rates some sites were actually almost zero. And you

111
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:34,250
can see here there is more of an exponential decrease

112
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,350
. And this is important because if you do expect

113
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:41,089
though infiltration rates, you want to make sure that

114
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:45,819
your study time is sufficiently long enough so that you

115
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,310
do reach linearity and you can't determine your infiltration rate

116
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:54,660
. So, as I said, surface scores were

117
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,850
collected at the infiltrate and feel trauma test sites.

118
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,680
This is, ah, the data from the laboratory

119
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,649
analysis of those surface scores. Uh, major point

120
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:09,410
here is the wash sites, which the site wanted

121
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,350
to have a greater percentage of sand. Um,

122
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,290
and not so much not is greater percentage of silt

123
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,769
. Now, keep in mind these are only the

124
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:24,910
first upper one foot of the study site. So

125
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:33,529
this doesn't necessarily describe complete subsurface. We also got

126
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:37,450
hydraulic conductivity is from this laboratory analysis. Um,

127
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:43,279
the hydraulic conductivity is do not necessarily match the infiltration

128
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,539
rates or the setting with which they were. These

129
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:48,110
sites are located. A Z can see. We've

130
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:54,220
got a higher hydraulic conductivity for one of these non

131
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,019
wash sites than we do. They wash sites and

132
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,500
you would expect the wash sites tohave higher hydraulic conductivity

133
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,169
due to the fact that they had higher infiltration rates

134
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:15,399
. Um, let's see. So our preliminary results

135
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,659
just from data collection before we got into the modeling

136
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,090
was that there was simple collection of surface infiltration rates

137
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,429
and core material. Um, the infiltration rates were

138
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:28,289
the Iast within the wash lower adjacent, awash in

139
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:33,490
still lower in the non washed, um, and

140
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,850
full trauma touch should be done. Um, should

141
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,330
be long enough. So that do reach linearity in

142
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,860
your data and soil texture data correlated with setting infiltration

143
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,379
. However, we did see the discrepancies in hydraulic

144
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:52,409
conductivity. So the next step in this process was

145
00:09:52,419 --> 00:10:00,269
to two parameter estimation to obtain the van connection.

146
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,129
Constance, these describe the shape of the wedding front

147
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:07,299
as they wedding from moves through the unsaturated zone and

148
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:09,850
those air needed for input into the V s to

149
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,169
the model. So that was the main use of

150
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:18,070
this computer program, Rosetta. It also gave us

151
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:22,259
hydraulic conductivity values that we could compare with not only

152
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,889
the laboratory hydraulic conductivity ease, but also the values

153
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:31,080
we were planning on getting from modeling. The infiltration

154
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,100
did it. You can see that there is quite

155
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,600
it could be quite a big difference between the laboratory

156
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,250
hydraulic conductivity, values and the result of values.

157
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,600
Which is somewhat odd because the input for the Rosetta

158
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,440
program was simply the particle size data from the laboratory

159
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,809
analysis. You would expect that would be some some

160
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:58,120
comparison there. However, the techniques are different.

161
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,450
See, do you have different numbers? Um,

162
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:11,149
so I Yes, Yes, Um, I see

163
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,740
. And so our hydraulic conductivity values were six times

164
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,559
10 the negative five toe, almost two times 10

165
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,460
mega, five feet per second, which is in

166
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,960
the range of fine sands that silty sands which correctly

167
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:33,039
describes with study area. Um, so then we

168
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,509
used our hydraulic conductivity values and the bank A nation

169
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,590
parameters as input in the V s too deep,

170
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:41,330
and we use visas to D, which is a

171
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:46,759
unsaturated zone flow model to estimate hydraulic properties. Based

172
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,470
on our info trauma data, we also used it

173
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,269
to create infiltration rate curves using those laboratory and Rosetta

174
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,450
hydraulic on activities to match with the field data.

175
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:01,730
Um, we also evaluated effective layering on near surface

176
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,559
of infiltration rate measurements because subsurface is not always a

177
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,169
homogeneous bloc of sand that can be layering compaction.

178
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,340
Um, and then finally, we provided a rough

179
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,909
estimate of the wedding front. Arrival time for its

180
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:20,820
surface, a one acre service infiltration pond. Just

181
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,080
to give. Ah, a rough estimate of toe

182
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,149
win. Recharge would begin if you did build upon

183
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,750
. So here is ah, the user interface for

184
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:41,580
V S two D. And this is actually a

185
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,370
grated model of our in full trauma test. This

186
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,730
is the model demand blocked out here We have.

187
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,480
Ah, this is a radio model. So this

188
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,799
upper left corner would be considered that the very center

189
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,220
of your Narine we have our entering here bounded by

190
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:01,480
our info, trauma or wall on our outer in

191
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,139
, founded by the outside in from trauma or wall

192
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,169
. You see, we have pondered water here to

193
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:11,700
simulate pond water inside the infiltration rings. Um,

194
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,929
greeting below the directly below them for trauma is smaller

195
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:22,730
space, creating the kind of helps with the precision

196
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,679
of the the modeling. And here you can see

197
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:31,179
, we have some of the model options. Just

198
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,909
wanted to show all the different options you have.

199
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:41,690
Important thing is the computation of inner cell relative hydraulic

200
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,870
conductivity for non radium. Oddo's um, the arithmetic

201
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,529
mean could give you the the best results for radio

202
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:56,299
models where you have a smooth wedding front or smooth

203
00:13:56,299 --> 00:14:00,940
wedding front. The geometric mean works well. However

204
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,149
, with infiltration into a very dry medium, you

205
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,179
have a very sharp wedding front. And so therefore

206
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,649
you need to use the upstream waiting option. Um

207
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,049
and then we chose the Vanga Nation model Teoh represent

208
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:22,870
the hydraulic kicked heuristic functions, and these were the

209
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,169
results of the V s to modeling RVs to D

210
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:28,879
. Modeling these top two Here are the wash sites

211
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,879
. These bottom Teoh are the near wash sites will

212
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,950
get to the non wash here in a second.

213
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,909
Um, you can see here we with the late

214
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:39,799
time data were matching well with our model field,

215
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:45,980
which is the black line and are actual field data

216
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,250
, which is the solid. This solid the line

217
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,250
. I'm not sure what that's not coming up.

218
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:56,250
Um, we have the The slopes match Well,

219
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,679
so we're getting the sand infiltration rate. However,

220
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,980
the cumulative infiltration is over estimated with our modeled results

221
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,509
and you can see the problem here is this early

222
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:09,990
time data. We're overestimating infiltration rates in the early

223
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,299
time. For all that, almost all of these

224
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:20,080
sites. Um And we're also, um the field

225
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,190
is here on this one here on this one there

226
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:33,769
on that one. And it would be, Yeah

227
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,360
, these air about the same. Um, another

228
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,460
thing to note here is that the Rosetta and laboratory

229
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:50,460
modelled curves compare well with one another, but underestimate

230
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:58,669
infiltration at these sites. Um, the conclusion I

231
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:02,250
got from this was that something in the near surfaces

232
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,570
, um, causing these discrepancies because you're Rosetta and

233
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,909
your laboratory values were derived from near surface material.

234
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:15,690
And you're also getting a difference in your infiltration rates

235
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,340
with near time data, which would be representative of

236
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:23,350
your near surface alluvial. You can see here with

237
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,350
the non wash sites. We don't have that problem

238
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:29,429
. The near surf are the near really time did

239
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:33,259
at near surface alluvial measurements. We have good matching

240
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,649
between modeled on field and lab here, um,

241
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,669
site for it's just kind of a mess. It

242
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:47,830
doesn't describe well, because we also have good matching

243
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,429
here between the field, the model in the laboratory

244
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:52,470
values as well. It's here. You can see

245
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,049
Rosetta's Still, for at least these three sites is

246
00:16:56,049 --> 00:17:03,370
underestimating infiltration data, and Rosetta is the input.

247
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,200
The Rosetta is strictly particle size analysis, and it

248
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:17,349
doesn't accurately describe complex scenario. So because we saw

249
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:22,309
evidence for Sir official layer at the washing near wash

250
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,809
sites, we wanted to test the modeling program to

251
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:29,420
sensitivity the layering. Um, here we did two

252
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,119
scenarios, one with the three inch thick silt layer

253
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,920
and one with a three inch thick clay layer a

254
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,890
different depths of 25 and 10 feet, the low

255
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,450
land surface. The first thing to note is that

256
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,950
clay would have a lower hydro hydraulic conductivity, and

257
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:55,200
so you would therefore expect the que middle of infiltration

258
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:57,029
to be less for clay than you would sell.

259
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,680
You see here from these models that fairly equal.

260
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:08,589
So it's the difference between the permeability of your low

261
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:15,460
permeability layer and surrounding. Alu Veum doesn't control the

262
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,369
decrease in your infiltration rate caused by that layer as

263
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:23,579
Muchas, the proximity to the land surface layers close

264
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:26,049
of service, as you can see have a greater

265
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:32,240
effect on infiltration rate, then layers deeper in the

266
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,670
subsurface. This also shows that between two and five

267
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,180
feet. You start to lose your sensitivity to that

268
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,569
layering and anywhere between five and 10 feet. You

269
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:48,200
probably wouldn't predict the late detective layer four models around

270
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,759
, uh, at these links, models are on

271
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,410
it. Greater links might possibly be able to detect

272
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:03,349
those layers deeper, uh, deeper dubs. So

273
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:06,779
we know the model is sensitive to layering. We

274
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:11,720
have evidence for sir official low permeability layer. And

275
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,650
we wanted to test to see if that would have

276
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,890
any effect on our model results. So we tested

277
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,710
our wash near Washington on wash sites again. Here

278
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,930
, in the near wash, we have a 0.75

279
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,430
foot thick surface. Layers of the first of upper

280
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,400
0.75 feet is a low permeability layer. And you

281
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,240
can see that does help us match this in your

282
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,160
time data. Better than our scenario where there was

283
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,470
no layering. So there is evidence off, sir

284
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,670
, official layering here at this site there may be

285
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,279
further layering that would cause the better match here with

286
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,500
this later time data, you can see here the

287
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,809
near wash site, you have slightly better prediction or

288
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:04,099
estimation of infiltration for the near time data with this

289
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:08,519
layered model. Again, it's a 0.75 foot thick

290
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,420
surface layer. But once he gets to the late

291
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,910
time data, the there's really very little difference.

292
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,970
So there is evidence that there possibly could be a

293
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,619
surf sir official layer the near wash sites, but

294
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:26,299
it doesn't have as much of an impact on your

295
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:29,200
infiltration rate as it would in the wash sites,

296
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,710
and you can see with our non wash sites.

297
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,670
There's no difference at all between layered, homogeneous,

298
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,549
and therefore there's really no evidence for sir official low

299
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:49,730
permeability layer at the non wash sites. So the

300
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,029
results of the modeling was that at the non wash

301
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:55,990
sites, we had a good agreement between modeled and

302
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,849
laboratory hydraulic conductivity values, which means that the double

303
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:03,720
ring in full trauma ter is a useful in estimating

304
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,970
the rate of water movement through the subsurface. If

305
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,549
you're assuming homogeneous, um, hydraulic properties throughout the

306
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:19,460
subsurface, um, any layering for short tests such

307
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,470
as we did lesson five hours. I wouldn't tell

308
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,950
you any lettering below 2 to 5 feet. Therefore

309
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,450
, you may need to do longer test, Um

310
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:36,390
, and again the wash sites. Watch sites should

311
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:44,569
evidence for its official low permeability crossed Um, And

312
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,839
so the next step was to do upon simulations to

313
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,519
just give a rough estimate of recharge times if these

314
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,650
ponds were constructed. Um, we chose site to

315
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:02,460
site for his representative sites of the two recharge areas

316
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,240
we discussed earlier. Sightsee being north of the Pencil

317
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,700
Mountain Fault in Yuck. Awash in sight for being

318
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,259
south of Pinto Mountain Fault. A non watch setting

319
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,819
, um, the wedding front reached the water table

320
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:21,059
, which is 400 feet below land surface at about

321
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:25,779
336 hours for a site to which is roughly 14

322
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:30,220
days site for we had a lower infiltration rates.

323
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,329
As you'd expect, recharged took longer and was at

324
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:38,450
the war water table 1080 hours or 45 days.

325
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:47,089
Here's the recharge rates that we that were provided by

326
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:52,140
the model site to pond Recharge was 21 feet per

327
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,539
day, and Side five recharge was five feet per

328
00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:00,589
day. Now these values air extremely low values for

329
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:04,029
recharge times because this model assumes only uniform hydraulic properties

330
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:10,430
throughout unsaturated zone and doesn't account for come compaction with

331
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,099
death and consolidation or changes in sub surface geology.

332
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:22,099
Just as a comparison upon and Victorville California recharge was

333
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:26,089
three years and infiltration rate was three feet when it

334
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:32,500
began and decreased 0.5 feet by the time um,

335
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:36,789
recharged began. Um, in the war in basin

336
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,980
area, we have a recharge pond where recharge time

337
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,750
took about three months so it can vary. But

338
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,950
again, these air extremely high values, and you

339
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,599
would expect lower values. Teoh changes in the sub

340
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:56,750
surface geology. So the overall conclusions was that the

341
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,329
study site in Joshua Tree is suitable for artificial recharge

342
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,380
, assuming the uniform hydraulic properties recharged by pond but

343
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:11,450
began at earliest, 14 45 days, Um
