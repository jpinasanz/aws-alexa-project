1
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:49,299
What? No. Yeah. Are you right?

2
00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:15,930
One thing. No, no. Four. Allow

3
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:32,900
people what I could find a way friend part ready

4
00:01:32,920 --> 00:02:00,340
for one. You know, woman Now. And

5
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:13,250
what over. But what you have? Yeah,

6
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:58,389
this one on What? No, I work that

7
00:02:58,400 --> 00:04:03,270
way. Important. Yeah. Yeah, about Thank

8
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,259
you so much for the kind introduction, Erik.

9
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:10,129
So as he mentioned, this work has been done

10
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:13,780
in conjunction with two universities universities, Gajah Mada in

11
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,649
Indonesia and, of course, San Diego State University

12
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,819
. So since this is being recorded, I'd like

13
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,930
to say a few words to the Indonesian audience that

14
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,850
will be viewing this at some point climates young to

15
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,519
go and took part of when you actually gone.

16
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,069
Sudan Who messed it up when we start over Namazi

17
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:35,449
Younggu bigger and took Farahat Dhiren young men. Mexican

18
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,850
president has testes side Indonesia. That simply means thank

19
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,259
you for the Indonesian audience. So the thesis title

20
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,149
is using the analytic hierarchy process, or hp to

21
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:53,550
identify areas of potential slope instability incurring on your Indonesia

22
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,560
. I will be using the term landslide quite often

23
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,670
in this presentation. So I'd like to define what

24
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,060
that means. It is defined by Barnes, 1978

25
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:04,040
. As a downward outward movement of slow for materials

26
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,759
composed of land, rock or combination, it could

27
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:13,310
be further subdivided by geoscientists by material mechanism of movement

28
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,310
and rate of movement. But for this presentation,

29
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,230
I will be using the term landslide to refer to

30
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,160
any form of slope failure. Now, I also

31
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,850
like to introduce the concept of hazard and risk.

32
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,079
Hazard is the probability of occurrence of a certain geological

33
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,519
event, such as a landslide to occur in a

34
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,350
particular area. Risk is the potential of economic or

35
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,750
social loss that may occur from that hazard geological event

36
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,339
. So seeing this infographic hazards on the left assets

37
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:44,680
on the right where they overlap is risk. Now

38
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:46,779
, in this presentation, I'll be using the term

39
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,189
landslide hazard susceptibility. What I mean by that is

40
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,279
the probability of occurrence of any form of soap failure

41
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:57,470
in a particular area. So this study is based

42
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,490
in Indonesia, and I'd like to give some background

43
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,480
there. Indonesia is composed of more than 13,600 islands

44
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,120
. Five of them are considered the large principal islands

45
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,060
, but about 6000 of them are inhabited. The

46
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,829
population is about 250 million people. Compared to United

47
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:18,129
States, which is about 320 million people. Here

48
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,879
in Indonesia, the population is not evenly distributed.

49
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,100
In fact, on the island of Java, about

50
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,720
60% of the people live. It's about 150 million

51
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,839
people, and that's where this study is based to

52
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,959
give a little background on the regional geology. The

53
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,670
story here is heavily influenced by the conversion interaction of

54
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,490
three major tectonic plates, the Eurasian plate in the

55
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,199
north east, abducting Indian Australian plate in the south

56
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,949
and the east, the Pacific Plate in the east

57
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,480
, Indonesia as a nation has been consecutively ranked two

58
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,660
or three. That second or third as a nation

59
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,589
worldwide in terms of fatalities attributed to rain triggered landslides

60
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:01,980
. And I'm going to try to explain why that

61
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,639
is briefly so. This conversion margin here is called

62
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,410
the Soon Arc. It is one of the most

63
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,519
classic volcanic arc localities in the world, with a

64
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,490
well defined trench in a four arc basin defined by

65
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,889
the islands of Java and Sumatra. This conversion margin

66
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,089
has produced some very nasty earthquakes, including the 9.3

67
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:26,819
magnitude earthquake in 2000 for which created a tsunami that

68
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:30,610
garnered worldwide attention. In addition, it's also home

69
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,579
to some of the most explosive historic volcanic eruptions,

70
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,750
such as Oba Tambora Krakatoa, in addition to many

71
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,589
others. So if you were to get in an

72
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:42,569
airplane and look out in the horizon on the island

73
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,509
of Java, seen here is a picture of Mount

74
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,879
Merapi and Mountain More Babu. You would see volcano

75
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,519
after volcano back after volcano, all these volcanic edifices

76
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,569
off into the distance. And besides Theseventies that these

77
00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:01,550
create which are quitter. Neri, relatively sensitive to

78
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,029
slope failure, Ashes plays, lahar, flow deposits

79
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:07,209
, things of that nature. They're also very steep

80
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:11,550
, and there are a lot of people living in

81
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,490
these areas directly on the flanks of these volcanoes,

82
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,560
as seen in this image. In addition, I

83
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:18,870
would like to remind you that we are on the

84
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,430
equator, where rainfall is above average compared to the

85
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,149
rest of the world. So all of these things

86
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,139
come together to lead to a situation where landslides are

87
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,559
very prevalent. So coming back into Java island where

88
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,399
the study is based, I'd like to draw attention

89
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,820
on this geological map by Smith at all 2008 to

90
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,970
this band of volcanic centres signified by these red triangles

91
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,850
on this map and surrounding each of them is a

92
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,289
lavender polygon which represents soon arc sediments. The sooner

93
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:56,250
our sentiments are composed of lahar flow deposits, ash

94
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:01,110
and clay layers, wretches and usually under lane by

95
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,929
massive and decide blocks with no significant betting and tertiary

96
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:09,500
limestone, my field area is located on the flanks

97
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,490
directly in one of these soon arc sentiment polygons right

98
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,470
here, seen by this red box, the moving

99
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,470
closer to my field area, which is called carne

100
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,399
on your regency in Central Java, Indonesia. A

101
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,769
Regency, by the way, is a second level

102
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:26,289
administrative division, which means it's equivalent to a county

103
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,419
in American terms. And this is a slope shaded

104
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:33,059
GM map of this, uh, study area,

105
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,830
and I hope you can see that it ranges from

106
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,980
70 meters at its lowest to 3300 meters at its

107
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:41,259
highest, and it includes the peak of Mount Lau

108
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:45,169
, which is the volcanic centre that is in this

109
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,129
area. No matter how is not an active volcano

110
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:50,850
. It has had a last eruption in 18 85

111
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,809
. But regardless, the geology of this region is

112
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:58,980
totally dominated by loud products. This is largest polygon

113
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,250
here on the geology map, which is the lahar

114
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:05,059
deposits from outlaw do and seen over here in light

115
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:09,480
blue is Critter Neri lower products, which is tends

116
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,379
to be exposed, and a site and bridges.

117
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,870
There are some other units here that are derived from

118
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,330
other volcanoes in neighbouring regions that have caused eruptions that

119
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,549
were explosive enough to deposit sentiments within this field area

120
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,129
. And there are also some small outcrops, relatively

121
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:31,899
small of tertiary and a site and limestone. Now

122
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,809
, before I talk too much about my master's thesis

123
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:35,669
, I want to introduce the problem here by talking

124
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:39,990
about my bachelors thesis. I went to Indonesia for

125
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,000
the first time in 2011 and did a program that

126
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,460
was a community empowerment program that had the goal of

127
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,080
developing and applying a method to teach. Indonesian nationals

128
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,330
had attacked hazard and risk from landslides, and as

129
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,929
a result of that, I also produced what I

130
00:10:54,929 --> 00:11:00,429
called a landslide hazard susceptibility map where the green polygons

131
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:03,629
are meant to signify low hazard susceptibility and the red

132
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,809
ones are meant to signify high hazard susceptibility. But

133
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:07,590
I'd like to point out here that there's a lot

134
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,860
of blank spaces on this map, and that's because

135
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,059
the primary method I used to create this was visual

136
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:18,100
observation. I was out there looking for signs of

137
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,830
cracking signs of past landslide events, things of that

138
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,529
nature or active landslides using the hypothesis that areas where

139
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:28,919
there has been passed land sliders, active landslide,

140
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:31,450
there will be landslides in the future. But I

141
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,149
wasn't able to go to all these places because being

142
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:39,039
foreign and also there's a lot of steep topography and

143
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,029
a lot of dense vegetation and not a lot of

144
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:45,049
roads in the traditional sense that we know them.

145
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,940
Um, so this is was this was the result

146
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,389
of of that work. Now, the people that

147
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:54,019
I was doing this community empowerment project with, we're

148
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:54,929
doing this for class. They're doing this for the

149
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:58,879
requirements for bachelors graduation at the university s Gaja monitor

150
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:03,070
, and they went forward and they extrapolated out into

151
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,639
the entire region of plus or a Joe, which

152
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,889
is about 11 square kilometres. And if you notice

153
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:11,669
here, there are some V shaped topography lines that

154
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:16,779
indicate either ridges and valleys that are kind of blanket

155
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,990
it as green. I don't know the methods that

156
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,690
they used to extrapolated here cause it wasn't published.

157
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,450
It was turned in for an assignment at a university

158
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,789
. But I have a sneaking suspicion that it wasn't

159
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,759
very statistical. And the only reason I'm showing you

160
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,649
this map is to point out that we could probably

161
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:37,399
do a more justified job at making a landslide hazard

162
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,250
map. And that's the objective of this thesis.

163
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,909
To make a landslide hazard separately, Map for cargo

164
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:46,110
on your Central Java that uses and tests HP or

165
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,629
analytic hierarchy process as a slope. Instability predictor references

166
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:54,350
. Existing landslides assigns weights to slope instability or physical

167
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,950
conditions that lead to slope instability and extrapolates those weights

168
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,820
to outside areas. So this is what the animal

169
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,269
Karki process looks like an equation form. The goal

170
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:07,490
of it is to obtain an L S I value

171
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,830
, which indicates how much hazard there is. What's

172
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,870
the probability of a landslide to occur in that area

173
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,820
? It's a numeric value that is found by the

174
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,129
some of factor weights, times class weights, and

175
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:22,649
it will be easier to show this visually. So

176
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,870
let's say I have a set of physical conditions.

177
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,889
These are my factors. These are categories of physical

178
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:31,409
conditions such a slope. Steepness, geology, land

179
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:35,090
use, river proximity. This is just an example

180
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,809
. This whole thing is a demonstration to show you

181
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:39,809
how this is done. All of them are assigned

182
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:43,159
factor weights now on each factor. There are also

183
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,870
a set of classes. So in this case I

184
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,419
have three classes of slope steepness, which are ranging

185
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,590
There been numbers to indicate what is the slope steepness

186
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,679
? In what group does it fall in? So

187
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:58,259
let's say I have a slope steepness of 55 degrees

188
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:00,980
in a particular area. That means the class wait

189
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,830
in that area would be 550.7. I would multiply

190
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,610
that by one to have an overall contributing value to

191
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,909
the Ellis I of 0.7. Now, how then

192
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,629
do I get these factor in class weights? This

193
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,549
is done through the analytic hierarchy process via pair wise

194
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:22,850
comparison. So, for example, I'm going to

195
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,809
present three factors. Let's call them A B and

196
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:28,409
C. So let's say I know through theory or

197
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:33,230
observation, that B is twice as important to landslide

198
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:39,509
generation or a influencing slope. Instability as a following

199
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,649
A is twice as influential to soap instability at sea

200
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,960
and finally be is three times as influential to slope

201
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,049
instability as C. I then have these numbers,

202
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:50,240
which I can arrange in a matrix form and there

203
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,740
in verses here and I can solve for the principal

204
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,409
Eigen Vector, which gives me a consistency ratio.

205
00:14:56,419 --> 00:15:00,210
The consistency ratio in this case is 30.79 tells me

206
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,570
how consistent my comparison values are. If I was

207
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,659
, for example to say that C is much more

208
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,429
important, then be in this case, then my

209
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:13,529
consistency value would shoot up because I've already established a

210
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:15,750
relationship between A. B and C, and it

211
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,350
wouldn't logically follow. But in this case, like

212
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,240
consistency, value is sufficiently low. Satti, 1980

213
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,539
who designed this is a decision making model so that

214
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:28,679
10% or less with sufficient so in this case were

215
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,029
much lower than that so we can move on now

216
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:35,539
. I set up my matrix again and I take

217
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:39,429
the sum of every column here, and then I

218
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:43,000
divide each cell individually by that some to create a

219
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,549
table of decimals, which is then produces a row

220
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:50,639
that could be averaged in my final average for this

221
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:54,429
outcome is my factor. Wait. So in this

222
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:58,019
case, based on my comparison assumptions for A B

223
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,149
and C, I produced a outcome that said Be

224
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,659
is my most influential to landslide generation, followed by

225
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:10,230
a followed by sea. So how do I apply

226
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,879
this to map generation? Well, this could be

227
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:19,529
done using raptors raster images and raster czar matrix arrangements

228
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:25,179
of numbers that can be used to depict map or

229
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,269
a raise of information. This is commonly how Slope

230
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:30,389
D. M's slope shaded D. M's are presented

231
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,440
, where you have a pixel that has a certain

232
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,899
resolution and a number is attached to it, and

233
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:37,419
then you have it displayed over in array. Now

234
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:41,559
, my goal in this study is to providing ls

235
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,820
I value for every pixel. So every pixel in

236
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,019
map format is going to have a certain slope steepness

237
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,509
value a certain geology, a certain land use certain

238
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,600
river proximity value. And if I have my factor

239
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,440
and class waits for all of these physical conditions,

240
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,389
and I can assign an l S I value across

241
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:03,200
the whole thing with the goal of detecting where is

242
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,450
the best fit area for landslide initiation or the highest

243
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:14,430
configuration of slope instability factors? This has been applied

244
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,269
in other field areas in terms of landslide hazard in

245
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,789
Iran, China, Nepal and Turkey, for example

246
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,690
. And they all found it somehow relevant to landslide

247
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,329
hazard analysis. They all had different hypotheses in different

248
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:30,019
objectives, but they all found it somewhat applicable to

249
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:30,730
this study. And the reason I'm putting the slide

250
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,380
here is just to demonstrate that I'm not the 1st

251
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,150
1 to have tried this. Now we'll talk about

252
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,589
my field area specifically. One point I'd like to

253
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:42,980
mention straight away is that I received a very important

254
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,720
bit of information from Luke Weidman and his bachelor's thesis

255
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,190
Weidmann 2014 because he did a community service apartment program

256
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,230
just like I did, but in a different area

257
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,460
in a different year, within the same blanket scarring

258
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,450
on your regency. And during his study, he

259
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,109
produced a inventory of evidence for slope instability as seen

260
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,589
here for an area called Step on John, which

261
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:10,519
is about six square kilometers now. Also for step

262
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,769
on, John, I have river network information,

263
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:15,299
land use, inroads, geology and topography data and

264
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:19,269
therefore have slope steepness. So these are the factors

265
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:22,900
I used in my HP model dark boxes. Here

266
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,359
are my factors and the lighter red boxes are the

267
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,440
classes within each factor. So how do I compare

268
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,079
these on a pair wise basis in order to get

269
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,230
my factor in class weights? Well, three of

270
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,109
these factors air numerical in nature, so that presents

271
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:42,619
a unique opportunity for me to do trend analysis between

272
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:45,930
my slope instability, evidence in step on junk and

273
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,869
these numerical values. For example, using distance to

274
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:53,569
roads here, I overlay distance to road polygons,

275
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:57,660
which are made with 40 meter increments made arbitrarily.

276
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,549
But now I can check to see if it actually

277
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,200
is related to anything on the ground. My goal

278
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,490
here is to figure out how much slope instability evidence

279
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,660
falls within each of these polygon. So if there

280
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,890
is to be a relationship between roads, distance two

281
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:17,809
roads that I'm assuming which is distance Saros road cuts

282
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:21,960
causes mawr exacerbation of slope instability and therefore landslides,

283
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,869
and there should be mawr evidence for landslides close with

284
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:26,809
roads and less and less as we get away from

285
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:29,940
it and that's exactly what we see for the most

286
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,799
part. So it looks like there is a negative

287
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:37,299
correlation between increasing percent area affected and distance from roads

288
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:40,910
, with the exception of 202 140 meters, which

289
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,180
of course, is explained by the fact that distance

290
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,589
the road is not the only reason are landslides in

291
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:48,940
this field area. So I also did this with

292
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,269
my other numerical values, including slope, steepness and

293
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,549
distance from rivers. And it turned out that slope

294
00:19:55,549 --> 00:20:00,380
steepness appears to be the most related correlative to landslide

295
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,089
evidence and distance rivers that appears to be quite randomly

296
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:07,549
distributed. It happens to be the least related using

297
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:12,160
this method to my landslide inventory or evidence for slope

298
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,190
instability from Weidmann 2014 and that means that doesn't mean

299
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,069
that we can't use it. But the assumption here

300
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:21,920
is that it should be compared lower in terms of

301
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,240
the comparison data. So how then do I include

302
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,609
non numerical factors such as mythology and land use?

303
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,849
Well, I had to rely on some subjective assumptions

304
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,299
uh, the elements considered where data type, What

305
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,440
is the data actually showing me in the case of

306
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,569
geology. I have a map but doesn't have anything

307
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,650
about betting. Doesn't have anything about the soil thickness

308
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,210
. Is a parent geology or is it surface geology

309
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,130
? Well, in this case, it didn't have

310
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,150
any information about betting. Didn't have anything about the

311
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:52,200
type of soil above it or the thickness of soil

312
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,039
. So therefore, I weighed surface manifestations such as

313
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:00,349
slope steepness and land use higher than geology. In

314
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:03,869
this case, I also consider data quality. What

315
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:07,079
was the resolution in the date that the data was

316
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,349
taken and some references that have used HP and fast

317
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,460
. So based on this pair wise comparison, my

318
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,500
weight values ended up being slope steepness is the highest

319
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,710
contributor to slope instability, followed by land use,

320
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,660
and then finally, distance to river at the end

321
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,660
. So how then do I move on and get

322
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,670
my class weights? Well, this is done in

323
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,680
a similar way. I over laid each of my

324
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,730
factors individually with the evidence for landslide or slope instability

325
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,920
, and what I was trying to do here is

326
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,809
try to figure out how much evidence for slope instability

327
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,519
falls within each class. With the hypothesis again that

328
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:48,970
areas that show past land sliding or current land sliding

329
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:51,819
will show land sliding in the future. So in

330
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:52,940
this case, the case of land use, I

331
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,940
found that the most evidence for slope instability is within

332
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,079
the settlement presidential areas, followed by the lower basis

333
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,630
plant, paddy fields and the agriculture. Now the

334
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,769
way I did. My pair wise comparison of these

335
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:10,970
classes is proportional to the size of these bars.

336
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,809
So in this case it looks like settlement Residential is

337
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:17,079
a little bit under twice is biggest lower basis plant

338
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,920
and just a bit bigger than Patty Field. So

339
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,079
when I made my comparison values, I ended up

340
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:26,130
comparing them in such a way that made class weights

341
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,359
that are proportional to go to that graph proportional to

342
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,329
the evidence for slope instability found within them. I

343
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:36,059
did this for all of my classes and all of

344
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,569
my factors to create unique values for each glass and

345
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:41,799
each factor, and therefore be able to apply the

346
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:45,720
LS I values to a map within CEPA and Young

347
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,480
, which looks like this. So there's some patches

348
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,950
of red, but overall there's a lot of green

349
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,720
zone one into areas. There's some yellow associated with

350
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,650
the red. So I check if this makes any

351
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,559
sense. Well, the easiest way to do it

352
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:02,170
would be to look at the evidence for slope instability

353
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,359
and put it back on my final map because this

354
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,779
was used to create this map. So this is

355
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:08,980
circular here. What I should see is I should

356
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,319
see a very strong, positive correlation between donation class

357
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,640
and increasing evidence for soap instability. And that's exactly

358
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,069
what I see. So it turns out that there's

359
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:22,349
a strong linear relationship in this case between miso nation

360
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:26,829
increasing with the most evidence for soap instability falling into

361
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,460
red and yellow classes. So now that I have

362
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,680
this information, what I have done is I've described

363
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,680
the inventory that I input into the map. Haven't

364
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,029
I have theorized what the ground truth is? But

365
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,609
what I've exactly done is produced a set of values

366
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:49,089
of factoring class weights that exactly describes the landslide inventory

367
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,660
within step on junk. So what would happen then

368
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,640
, if I applied? Those factor in class waits

369
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,839
to an area where I don't have any landslide inventory

370
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,650
control. This is telling Manu it's a sub district

371
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,480
. It's just an administrative level up higher than seven

372
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,599
. John, Where is which sits right here.

373
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,480
It does include the peak of Mount Lahu there.

374
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,119
So when I apply those factoring class waits, I

375
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,480
make a map. It looks like this. Now

376
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:19,950
the red patch here, just visually is red patch

377
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,369
here, near to the peak of Mount Lahu,

378
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,099
which indicates steep slopes. But over here we have

379
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:27,759
an intermediate area that's still steep, but these are

380
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,299
dense forests were not. A lot of people are

381
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:33,200
living and then we have these large red areas that

382
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,990
are the combination of people living in settlements on steep

383
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,250
slopes, possibly near rivers, possibly near roads and

384
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:47,400
possibly on lahar type geology. Then also, what

385
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,019
would happen if I extrapolated throughout the entire car in

386
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:52,160
on your regency? So this is this is tell

387
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,259
him and you in relation to car ng on yee

388
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:57,299
are just as an indicator here. And when I

389
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,829
apply, my factoring class waits to Carling on your

390
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:02,829
It produces a map that looks like this now just

391
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:04,710
visually inspecting this, it appears to me that there

392
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,890
is a clustering of red values red area in the

393
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,519
northeastern portion of car nine yard. We'll come back

394
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:15,309
to that. But first I'd like to discuss how

395
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:17,420
do I test these maps? How do I check

396
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,759
to see if they actually work in any way?

397
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,250
Well, the first way I'd like to do that

398
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,380
is to introduce a piece of information set of data

399
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,950
that hasn't yet been mentioned. And that is the

400
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:32,240
landslide incident. Reports from Baby Day card Manyara,

401
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:37,289
the disaster management office that responds to and reports disasters

402
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:38,839
within this area. So that's me. And as

403
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:41,130
the leader of Big Redecard on yard, my advisers

404
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,589
from Indonesia and some Indonesian students and Kenneth graduated last

405
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:48,059
year, who visited Indonesia to do his own bachelors

406
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,980
thesis during this period of time and then some workers

407
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,230
for baby, they card on your now. They

408
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,829
have been taking incident reports on landslide since 2008.

409
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:00,089
They just began in 2008 and they very graciously gave

410
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:03,279
me all the incident data that they had for landslides

411
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:08,720
between 2010 and 2012. Now, this information was

412
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,849
in document based format. It was not digital in

413
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:15,690
any database. Um, and it didn't have any

414
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,089
GPS coordinates, so I couldn't use it as a

415
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:21,059
geo referenced landslide inventory, which would have been very

416
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,380
helpful in producing my comparison values. For the HP

417
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,230
analysis, however, it did have a lot of

418
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:32,049
very good information regarding incidents. Uh, statistics of

419
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,319
money in amount of victims, things of that nature

420
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,250
. There's about 268 reports, and it also they

421
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:41,579
each had address information on them. So down to

422
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:45,440
the lowest administrative boundary that I have in my yeah

423
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,880
yes platform, which is the village the day So

424
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,980
level Aiken been these incident reports to see where they

425
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,920
are coming from just in general. So one of

426
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,440
the early goals of this thesis was to create an

427
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,700
incident report input form that would automatically make an Excel

428
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,009
database of these incidents. So what I did is

429
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:11,529
I scripted this using visual Basic and Microsoft Excel with

430
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:15,289
the help of Dr Gallagher. These programming class and

431
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,849
I presented it to the Baby Day office in late

432
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:22,339
2013. It's an Indonesian language. It uses all

433
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:26,019
the information that they input on their incident reports already

434
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,700
, Um, but it's only having to do with

435
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:36,299
landslides, and I I never received any information further

436
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:37,970
about this. I put Bill no down here in

437
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,940
case there's any errors to please contact us, and

438
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,049
we can help you through it, etcetera. But

439
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:44,529
I never heard anything back, and I can only

440
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,940
assume that it probably wasn't used. Even though I

441
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,170
spent a couple hours out there with a translator training

442
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,849
someone had used it. They're very enthusiastic about it

443
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,529
. They like the idea, but my thought is

444
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:56,990
it's probably not robust enough. There's a number of

445
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,339
reasons why this could have gone wrong. It doesn't

446
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:03,470
have the narrative that they put in the incident reports

447
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,839
themselves, which is very cultural and characteristic. It

448
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,089
was meant to be done alongside the instant reports,

449
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,289
which is adding work to them. And if they

450
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:14,539
don't see the benefit, then there might be no

451
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:15,910
incentive to do so. And they might have need

452
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,069
something might have needed something that dealt with more than

453
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:21,960
just landslides, which is all this is is referring

454
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,349
to regardless, I was still able to use this

455
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:27,230
incident report form to make my own database in order

456
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,480
to check to see if my car go on your

457
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,769
map correlated with the distribution of incident reports so I

458
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:38,420
will discuss the results. This is the map that

459
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:44,509
was produced by the distribution of incident reports within car

460
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:47,960
gone yard. And the graduated color here, ranging

461
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,630
from light orange to dark orange, indicates how many

462
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,019
instant reports refer to that village in terms of victims

463
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,400
or location of landslide. And what it appears to

464
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,859
me here is that there's a clustering of incident report

465
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,960
High incident report villages in the northeast corner of Garden

466
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,170
Yard. If I put a broad circle around that

467
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:12,289
and I bring back my HP map just to visually

468
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:15,720
see how it correlates, it appears to me that

469
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,619
they fall. It falls roughly in the same cluster

470
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,970
of red that I identified in the HP prediction.

471
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:26,609
So viewing that statistically if I plot the top 10

472
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:30,849
red zones by percent area in yellow on this map

473
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:37,400
in the top 10 landslide incident report generators the top

474
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,700
10 villages that I referred to within incident reports in

475
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,630
appeal and the villages that have overlapping data in green

476
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,180
. What you see is there are four villages out

477
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,200
of the top 10 producers of landslide incident reports that

478
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,619
were identified by the HP prediction and in addition,

479
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:59,039
There are some other villages here that are identified by

480
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,730
the HP prediction that are adjacent to five of the

481
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:07,559
other incident report generators in this area. So this

482
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,759
demonstrates to me that there is indeed a clustering of

483
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:11,029
both data within the same area. So this is

484
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,839
somewhat of a great success, for it supports the

485
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,690
model of HB as a predictor of regional slope instability

486
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:23,240
. But we'll discuss that more in the discussion section

487
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,329
. So I also have a map for town man

488
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:27,569
you, which is a little bit smaller scale.

489
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:30,970
And I was actually able to take this map directly

490
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,849
to the field earlier this year. So I had

491
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:36,740
the wonderful privilege to go back to Indonesia in March

492
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,740
of this year. About a month and 1/2 ago

493
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:41,130
, I brought this map with me and I came

494
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,829
to the field with the goal of locating serious landslides

495
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:48,440
to see how they matched up with my predictions.

496
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,230
And I found four sites of serious land sliding,

497
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:52,819
and I'll just just each one of them individually.

498
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:56,059
So first is site one. This is me for

499
00:30:56,059 --> 00:31:00,250
scale. This is an extremely large landslide about 95

500
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,769
meters in with and it occurred directly adjacent to this

501
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:07,329
major road in an area where it's largely homogeneous soil

502
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,670
with pebbles of tough and and a site boulders.

503
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,380
So it's happening on a steep slope that was modified

504
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,910
by farming activity. It occurred in late 2014 according

505
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,230
to local knowledge, and it also occurred alongside other

506
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,549
landslides that were secondary. That didn't occur at the

507
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:29,759
exact same time, but they occurred in Uh uh

508
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,869
in the same month, is what I was told

509
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:33,950
by locals has this primary landslide, So there's about

510
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,420
two very large ones here. All this also discussed

511
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,200
site to, which is about 500 meters up the

512
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,130
road, which is slightly smaller. It's about 32

513
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,240
meters in size and this is the thing. Very

514
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,720
similar physical condition right next to the road in thick

515
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,170
, homogeneous soil with steep slopes and farming conditions.

516
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,950
Now this clustering of landslides in certain physical conditions because

517
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,839
although this is 500 meters away, it's almost the

518
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:07,309
same story. A site one indicates to me that

519
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:09,339
there is a value in looking for the configuration of

520
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:15,759
physical conditions, to look for soap instability just as

521
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,900
an aside there. But how did they plot with

522
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,529
my HP prediction? And what I found is that

523
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:22,690
they seem to plot in an area that is marked

524
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,180
as green as one and two. So before I

525
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,880
move on to far here, I want to mention

526
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,210
that there will be landslides in areas that are marked

527
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,089
as green. There is a certain percentage that must

528
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:37,609
happen in them in order for them to fit this

529
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:42,380
model. But given that these physical conditions air causing

530
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,819
landslides in more than one area, you would hope

531
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,250
that the HP method would detect these in yellow or

532
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,349
red area. Now, the next important thing I

533
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:52,240
want to point out is this purple line here which

534
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,319
indicates the major road, which is on the order

535
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,910
of 506 100 meters away from these sites. But

536
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,910
if you look at these pictures, it appears the

537
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:05,259
major road is directly next to these landslides. So

538
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:07,599
I thought maybe my GPS coordinates are wrong. I

539
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,839
went to a satellite image, imploded these sites there

540
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:12,690
, and it seems, in fact, that they

541
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,740
are plotting next to a linear feature seen here as

542
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,940
a tan line with dark red dashes. This is

543
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,549
a road that's under construction. So this road was

544
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:28,759
under construction in 2013 and my data was from 2012

545
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:31,490
so it didn't include this road, this major road

546
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,039
. If you see this right angle here that's going

547
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,349
off to the east with it's indicative bump, that's

548
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:39,720
the right angle right there. The indicative bump that

549
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,720
I'm referring to in my model I have not included

550
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,509
the updated road in my HP model, and it's

551
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:49,789
my belief that if I did, it would have

552
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:52,650
had the ability to bring it up in rank from

553
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,529
either yellow to red because it would have had the

554
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:58,220
road distance checked. It would have had a disturbance

555
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,410
of the soil. And there's also land use that

556
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,049
has been created as a result of this road,

557
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,820
so moving on insight. Three. This is a

558
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:13,260
very large landslide, the worst in recorded memory in

559
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,690
these Indonesian in this Indonesian area. This landslide occurred

560
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:22,820
during morning and it killed 65 people in 2007 so

561
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,219
it happened on a very steep slope with modification by

562
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:29,900
farming, and it was about 100 meters and with

563
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,360
so how did this very seriously landslide plot on my

564
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:36,610
HP mapple. It seems to have been targeted right

565
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,760
into an area of yellow and red. Now it's

566
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,860
a big white circle because it's too large landslide and

567
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,769
there's little bit error associated with it. However,

568
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,139
when you consider it against the background noise of green

569
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,989
areas, I see this is a very strong supporter

570
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:55,630
of the H B as a predictive predictor of this

571
00:34:55,630 --> 00:35:00,239
type of landslide, so moving on to site for

572
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,809
which is a completely different kind of landslide. Now

573
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,730
, this is a creeping landslide that occurred over a

574
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,420
long period of time and it's still ongoing and it's

575
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,210
very special because I was able to visit it over

576
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,329
this period of time while I was living in Indonesia

577
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,610
. So this is September 2012. This with me

578
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,309
and Kenneth again and my advisers and a driver looking

579
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:22,920
at cracking in the ground, standing on pavements near

580
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,400
this home and their vegetation down here. But we

581
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,289
can easily walk past this site here in September 2012

582
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:34,170
moving forward in January 2013 about four months later,

583
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,739
The area where we're standing actually isn't there anymore.

584
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,920
This is receded back completely. The house that used

585
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,650
to be there has been evacuated and scrapped and now

586
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,800
this scarf here is about probably 3 to 4 meters

587
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,489
in height. You could still walk across this area

588
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:52,519
now moving forward to August of 2013. The area

589
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,190
that I just pointed out that it could be walk

590
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,440
across is completely gone. It's completely eh vegetated.

591
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,780
And they've implanted this poll here to indicate further land

592
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,900
movement. Now. I also went back of this

593
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:07,670
in this year in March and this is what I

594
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,619
saw. This poll has been significantly strained and stressed

595
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,320
, so this landslide is still ongoing today. Although

596
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,469
it's a different kind of landslide completely. How does

597
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:20,769
it plot within my HP map prediction and it appears

598
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:25,130
the flooded area that's marked very largely relative to the

599
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:29,119
other ones as red. I'd also like to point

600
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,989
out here while we're on the slide to the southeast

601
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,239
. There's this large red area into the west.

602
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:38,289
There's another large area in which no similar slope instability

603
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:40,840
was seen. But I also want to point out

604
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:45,139
, just like when, just like were ableto have

605
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:49,030
landslides in green areas. We're also able to observe

606
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:53,369
red areas that don't have landslide processes and I also

607
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:57,300
want to remind you that what this model has actually

608
00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:00,840
done exactly is look for areas that are similar to

609
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:06,130
the landslide conditions to the physical conditions that were produced

610
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,389
. Landslides within seven junk the inventory that was input

611
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,199
into the model. So this is read exactly because

612
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,300
it is very similar to the conditions which caused landslides

613
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,500
in adjacent area. So just because it doesn't have

614
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,619
land sliding now doesn't mean that it can't in the

615
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,559
future, but should be noted that there is quite

616
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:30,170
a liberal painting of red along this area, so

617
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:34,519
results overview regionally. It successfully identified HP as a

618
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,929
model successfully identified areas known to be high producers of

619
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:40,619
landslide incident reports. It's like one into it failed

620
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:45,690
to detect these very serious large landslides attributed to having

621
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:50,550
outdated data. Site three successfully placed serious landslide against

622
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,659
a background of green area and site for successfully placed

623
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:55,820
the creeping event in a larger area. Overall,

624
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,429
there was many red areas without soap, instability,

625
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:04,150
evidence scene. So now let's have some discussion about

626
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:06,260
this. First, I'd like to point out some

627
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,710
potential sources of air in this method. First of

628
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,809
all the inventory that was very kindly given to me

629
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:16,400
by Luke Weidmann 2014 was I never meant to be

630
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,260
extrapolated, enforced on to the entire region. I

631
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,989
was actually fortunate enough to participate in some in a

632
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:29,030
very brief period of actually taking this inventory. And

633
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:32,949
, um, it includes not only landslides but rockfalls

634
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:37,389
and creeping and evidence for cracking things that actually haven't

635
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,820
fallen yet. This may account for some of that

636
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,170
liberal presence of red area that we saw on the

637
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,079
map. In addition, the data are clustered near

638
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,760
roads because just like in my thesis, where I

639
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,670
wasn't able to see the entire area, we used

640
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,809
the roads. We used motorbikes. We walked around

641
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:54,960
in order to make this information. I'm sure this

642
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,610
is the similar case for this thesis. So therefore

643
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:07,199
landslides that are near road are preferentially reported. In

644
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,000
addition, in my factor choice, I have slow

645
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,019
class river channel proximity and road proximity, all with

646
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,980
the intention of looking for slope channels. So slope

647
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:20,760
steepness And the reason I did this is because my

648
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:22,219
slow class map is made from a topography, met

649
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:27,780
from contour lines and therefore I couldn't haven't be too

650
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,489
high resolution because it started to create artifacts in the

651
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,650
data. So the resolution of that slope map is

652
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,199
pixel sizes of 50 meters by 50 meters, so

653
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:39,380
anything below 50 meters any change in slope below 50

654
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,900
meters would not be detected. Be sort of averaged

655
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,730
out according to the topography map. So I needed

656
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:51,309
some information from the river channels which arm or localized

657
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:52,030
in the road cuts, which are known to be

658
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:57,130
a large producer of landslides in this area. So

659
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,449
that being said, I have some well, first

660
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,619
, let's have some conclusions. I found HP to

661
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:07,320
be extremely useful, particularly for a preliminary landslide study

662
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,079
in an area where you have never been or you're

663
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:14,610
unable to go, particularly with areas in Southeast Asia

664
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,670
where there are wide areas of land that have never

665
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,900
been analyzed by geologists. This is a very low

666
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,260
cost, an attractive method for approaching those areas,

667
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:28,829
especially initially. Now I say low cost. Having

668
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:30,719
said that, the data I used was practically free

669
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:34,239
. I used information that was primary. I used

670
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:37,590
remote sensing information. I used information from past DC's

671
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:40,219
. However, uh, we found that there was

672
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:43,679
an issue with some of my data being updated.

673
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:45,030
I mean said you could potentially spend a lot of

674
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,780
money and put new data in here, and I

675
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:51,030
have some suggestions for a future study. And a

676
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,690
lot of these suggestions are actually for myself because I'm

677
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:57,139
currently working on a proposal or grant in order to

678
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,500
outline how this could be done another time in either

679
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,699
another area of the same area to achieve a much

680
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,079
more valuable effect. And what I recommend doing is

681
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,289
including high resolution D. M within it. So

682
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,349
maybe lied are imagery. This would eliminate the need

683
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:17,989
tohave roads in river channels as a factor completely,

684
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,380
so long as your slope class map is high enough

685
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,699
resolution to detect those features. You could, however

686
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:29,360
, have roads as vibration sources in river as something

687
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,980
to do with the hydrology situation, but they would

688
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:35,550
be set up differently in that event. Also,

689
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,650
I recommend a have a fit for purpose landslide inventory

690
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:37,909
. What I mean by that is one that is

691
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:43,880
made for HP, either one that is produced from

692
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:49,019
a database that is from the Disaster Management Office Baby

693
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:51,610
Day. Calling on you are that includes landslides from

694
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,590
all over scarring on your or one that is made

695
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,650
with a certain goal in mind, such as if

696
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:02,139
I'm only looking for classic translational rotational landslides in thick

697
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:07,710
soils above the thes the parent geology maybe above 30

698
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,840
meters squared affected area that I would only map those

699
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,909
those in my inventory and HP would give me exactly

700
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:17,630
the conditions that are conducive only to those landslides.

701
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,130
Also, I recommend putting some unique factors. Soil

702
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,099
thickness, rainfall distribution, Ashley ash, clay layer

703
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:27,920
coverage, vegetation analysis, etcetera. I believe that

704
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,329
this system allows for more complexity, and it benefits

705
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:34,420
from that. So because you can compare things on

706
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,840
a pair wise basis, more complexity is better.

707
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,250
So long a special care sticking to avoid redundancy in

708
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,239
the factors you don't want to types of factors that

709
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:49,420
are getting at the same physical condition, and also

710
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:52,059
it is very low cost to run HP once the

711
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:53,300
data is obtained so you can do it a number

712
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,130
of times once you have made a map, if

713
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,679
you have direct access to the field area, you

714
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,030
can take it and go to the field. And

715
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,239
if you find a landslide or something, that contradicts

716
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:06,409
your map. You can rearrange your weights and classes

717
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:08,280
and accommodate that in the landslide inventory without taking new

718
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:10,550
data. So once you've made the investment, you

719
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,989
can run it as many times as you want.

720
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:15,139
You can update it, and it could be relevant

721
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:19,320
to the time that it's created. So with that

722
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:21,079
, I will conclude. But I would like to

723
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:24,219
give some very well deserved acknowledgements, including to Dr

724
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:27,719
Dweik, read a carnal wadi or Emerita, as

725
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:30,250
we have come to call her for inviting me to

726
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,079
Indonesia in the first place. In 2011 she very

727
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,980
kindly allowed me to sit in on a meeting and

728
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,730
in that meeting without even knowing me, invited me

729
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,010
to go to a university to go to her country

730
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:45,030
. And that led to a 1.5 cumulative years of

731
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,300
living there in doing a dual degrees. And I

732
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:50,340
have a lot to thank her for for that.

733
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:52,590
In that regard, Dr Hua Hui Lopo for helping

734
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,590
me with the field excursion. He provided the translators

735
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,159
, the cars, the field equipment and he was

736
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,550
always saying yes to. Whenever I wanted to go

737
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,210
to the field, even when I came and Short

738
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:04,829
noticed early this year for 10 days, he said

739
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:07,090
, OK, let's go right now and then Dr

740
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,230
Eric Frost, of course, for a lot of

741
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,289
the same reasons as a burrito for putting the trust

742
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:16,219
in me to go and do this study abroad experience

743
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:19,670
without knowing me at all. Really? In 2011

744
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,699
when I first met him, I said, I

745
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,239
want to do something That was for the community.

746
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:22,920
Wanted to use geology to help people and he said

747
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:24,670
, Well, I have someone I'd like you to

748
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:30,670
meet And then it became This experience has completely changed

749
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,590
my education and really has completely changed my life because

750
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:36,760
of the some of the personal relationships that I have

751
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,980
maintained as a result of this experience. So I

752
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,860
could talk about that forever. But I'd like to

753
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:45,000
keep it brief. So also, faculty and students

754
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,210
of STS you geological science, especially Luke for allowing

755
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,750
me to use his landslide inventory in this study and

756
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,449
the faculty students of you, GM, geological Engineering

757
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:58,920
and to them, I'd like to say three Mukasey

758
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,340
Pseudomonas ton president Dusty SIA Oh, some will give

759
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,130
Berman fat Maggie Kita Samuel. Which means thank you

760
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,550
for watching this presentation. I hope that you all

761
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:14,059
found it valuable. I will be happy to open

762
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:25,369
the fourth question. Yes, when?
