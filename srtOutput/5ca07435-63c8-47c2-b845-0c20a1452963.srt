1
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:07,049
sports the thing you weren't quite good enough at for

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,789
your dad to love you. I absolutely love sports

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,609
. In fact, the only times I've cried as

4
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:16,510
a grown man have been while watching actors playing cultures

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,879
deliver inspirational speeches set to stirring music. This game

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,670
is not over. This battle is not over.

7
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:29,469
This is our time now. Second half is out

8
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:35,000
, weighed up all those inches. That's gonna make

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:53,210
the difference between winning Clear eyes. Full hearts way

10
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,229
are a lucky that Kyle Chandler is not a Scientologist

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,380
or I would be broke and married to Mimi Rogers

12
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,039
Right now. That's a fact. That's a true

13
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,099
fact. But look, tonight we're not going to

14
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:06,019
talk about the players on the field. We're gonna

15
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:08,579
talk about the fields themselves. Stadiums. America has

16
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,730
a lot off them, and they are increasingly fantastic

17
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:15,180
at the home of the Dallas Cowboys. Here's what

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,909
you also get really art by world renowned artists.

19
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:21,170
The party suite is all about watching the game or

20
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,760
concert in style. You can do bottle service,

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,549
you can set up. Come in before the game

22
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,659
, you know you get the snakeskin. You know

23
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,879
the ad, the gold Age Everybody knows where you're

24
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:33,609
sitting. There are 14 party cabanas and two pools

25
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,219
watched by lifeguards that looked out on the field.

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,310
Just look toward the end zone. Yep, those

27
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,549
swimming pools are inside the stadium. That's right.

28
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,760
You can now watch a game from a swimming pool

29
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,879
suspended above the field, where the real contest for

30
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,480
the fans is finding out whether or not HPV can

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,480
swim. My money's on HBV. That's a clutch

32
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,829
STD. That's clutch. Most new stadiums nowadays look

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,090
like they were designed by a coked up Willy Wonka

34
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,659
. And if you don't believe me, just look

35
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,479
at what the Miami Marlins have in Venue Ballpark.

36
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,969
That's a fish tank around the whole part. That

37
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:17,969
is awesome. Yes, the Marlins have actual aquariums

38
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:22,289
behind home plate, which is indeed awesome because you

39
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:23,650
get to watch baseball one of the same time watching

40
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:30,620
fish developed panic disorders. All those new finches are

41
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,919
clearly incredible. The problem is, they're also expensive

42
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,449
on. The vast majority of stadiums are built using

43
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:39,930
public money. One analysis found that between 4010 we

44
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,189
spent$12 billion building new facilities for professional teams,

45
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,490
which begs the question, Why sports teams are successful

46
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,210
businesses with wealthy owners, and yet they still get

47
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,080
our help. Two years ago, Detroit got approval

48
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,780
to spend more than$280 million in taxpayer money on

49
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,500
a new arena project for the Red Wings, just

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,060
six days after the city filed for bankruptcy. Even

51
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,789
though the Red Wings owner is Mike Village, the

52
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:10,389
founder off the Little Caesars pizza chain who's worth an

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,740
estimated 5.1 billion, that's a little hard to swallow

54
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,080
. I mean, sure, not as hard to

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,710
swallow as a Little Caesars crazy bread with an assortment

56
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,590
of Caesar tips, but still pretty hard. We

57
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,560
don't just help teams build stadiums. We let them

58
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,840
keep virtually all the revenue those stadiums then produce.

59
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,800
Just listen to the president off the Miami Marlins described

60
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,189
. They're not at all unusual deal. You get

61
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:39,189
the income from naming rights. Yes, you get

62
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:43,330
the income from concessions. Yes, you get the

63
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,069
luxury box income. Yes, you get the income

64
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:49,389
from non baseball events. That's the whole object of

65
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:52,270
this is to get more revenue. Wow, that's

66
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:53,919
that's pretty direct. You think I got into this

67
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,300
because our like sports one are you a child who

68
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,979
let a child host a television show. This is

69
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:02,219
all about the money, son. The money he

70
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:04,479
mentioned naming rights in there. And it is true

71
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:06,620
for most teams. If you sell the name of

72
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,669
your building, you get to keep the money.

73
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:13,419
Even when it's a stupid Is this the New Orleans

74
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,470
pelicans are going to be playing their home games at

75
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,310
the Smoothie King Center? Yeah, the Smoothie King

76
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,639
center on. You have to feel a bit for

77
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,170
the pelicans players. It can't be easy to protect

78
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,449
your home court when it's named after a slop of

79
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:32,300
yoga and kale ejaculated from a blender. But owners

80
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,509
monetizing every part of a stadium is so ingrained it's

81
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,550
even now a feature in the Madden NFL video game

82
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,579
. We're adding the ability to run your team as

83
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:46,300
an NFL. Being an owner isn't just about talking

84
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,819
, though. It's about taking action. Said prices

85
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:51,230
on concessions, merchandise and tickets upgrade your state,

86
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:55,250
improve everything from the parking lot to the locker room

87
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,620
. Incredible three Owner experience is apparently so realistic that

88
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,839
if you unlock a secret level, you can even

89
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,160
deal with the aftermath of making a racist comment.

90
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,649
That's that's incredible. Attention to detail for gamers Teams

91
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,870
Teams are so successful at pushing for upgraded stadiums that

92
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,699
since the early nineties we've had a replacement rate of

93
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:18,779
over 90%. We replaced stadiums even faster than we

94
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:21,879
replace Spider Men. Come on. What? Tobey

95
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,740
Maguire and Andrew Garfield were perfectly good state of the

96
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,850
art Spider Man. Almost every single team get some

97
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,540
kind of public money. Some, like the Yankees

98
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,009
, might build the stadium themselves, but on land

99
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:36,889
that they're given rent and property tax free, costing

100
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,220
New York City hundreds of millions in lost revenues.

101
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,139
But many others get their stadiums funded through tax exempt

102
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,800
municipal bonds, which, yes, sound like the

103
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,990
last words, an accountant says before his blind date

104
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,170
falls asleep at the dinner table. But they're actually

105
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,870
incredibly important. So so let me quickly try to

106
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,490
explain. Municipal bonds are away for the city to

107
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,920
take out a loan, which they then later repay

108
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,910
with interest, although usually through new or existing taxes

109
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,399
, they're supposed to be for things like roads or

110
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,990
schools, public goods that private industry would not pay

111
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,779
for. But they've been routinely miss used to finance

112
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,740
stadiums for decades, and often cities do it because

113
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,709
teams claim they can't afford to build stadiums themselves.

114
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:25,730
The Marlins got nearly$500 million toward their fish traumatizing

115
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,160
theme park by pleading poverty, although when Miami Dade

116
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,959
County tried to verify that something strange happened. Among

117
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,139
the questions they asked was, Can we see your

118
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,149
books? You said no, Right? Why didn't

119
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:40,540
you just open the books? Because it that easier

120
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,389
? Because in Major League baseball, history books are

121
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,680
just kept private. That's just how it is,

122
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,370
sure, but if the argument in Major League Baseball

123
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,889
history, that's just how it is always one,

124
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,930
we'd still have an all White League of Players gambling

125
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,319
on games, smoking cigarettes at the plate and dying

126
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,199
of syphilis. But that leaked documents later revealed that

127
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,459
despite denying they made a profit, the Marlins have

128
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:08,879
generated nearly 50 million over the previous two years.

129
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,850
And listen, pretending your poor is wrong, it

130
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,680
wasn't okay when Mary Kate Olsen went through her hobo

131
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,439
face. It's not OK now way haven't even mentioned

132
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,040
the ultimate bargaining chip that teams like to use,

133
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:25,579
threatening to leave right now. The Oakland Raiders,

134
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:28,170
the ST Louis Rams on the San Diego charges are

135
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,379
all threatened to move to Los Angeles unless they get

136
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:31,490
new stadiums. In fact, over the past two

137
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,079
decades, nearly half the NFL has been subject to

138
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,170
speculation about a move to L. A. It's

139
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,000
such a cliche that in the current Madden video game

140
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:42,629
, if you want a new stadium, a good

141
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,569
way to do that is to relocate the team on

142
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:47,670
the game. Even tells you the easiest choice financially

143
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,360
is. Guess where? Los Angeles on. If

144
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,189
you're a charges fan, that must be pretty infuriating

145
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,060
. Oh, come on, even might make believe

146
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,240
escapist entertainment is trying to move my King team to

147
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,939
L. A. In fact, charges fans are

148
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:07,560
currently so terrified their team might leave. Not only

149
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:09,199
are they campaigning to spend public money on a stadium

150
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:11,490
, they're doing it in one of the worst rap

151
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,759
songs of all time. Die Hard is almost went

152
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,079
on a rampage. I tell the lies. I

153
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:20,389
hope you understand why I got the best with the

154
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,220
best fans. Another hate them. They deserve a

155
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,470
brand new stadium, said Hagel. To find a

156
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,070
city, send eagle, the second largest city committee

157
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,740
Sindical making money put it back in our city.

158
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

159
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:39,389
What? Go back. Did he say second largest

160
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:41,500
city? That is a strange boast for a rap

161
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,570
song. You know, I got the second hardest

162
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,330
carcass on the second. Most paid. When I

163
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,120
go to the club, I get the second most

164
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,679
laid second mode. Second most. I'm not there

165
00:08:52,750 --> 00:09:00,029
. I'm number to go. Number two teams are

166
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:03,250
shameless in manipulating cities fears. In 1997 the Minnesota

167
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,990
Twins even ran an ad showing a player visiting a

168
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,269
child in hospital with cancer on the tagline. If

169
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:11,960
the twins leave Minnesota, an eight year old from

170
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,639
Wilma undergoing chemotherapy will never get a visit from Marty

171
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,750
Cordova, which is less like the Make a Wish

172
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:24,200
Foundation on More like the maker threats. Founder teams

173
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,389
don't just use threats to get what they want.

174
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:28,480
They also promise that new stadiums can work economic magic

175
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:31,759
. The Milwaukee Bucks, who are also currently threatening

176
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,750
to leave if they don't get a new arena,

177
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,919
are running this out. Now. The ripple effect

178
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:41,840
starts here. This is Wisconsin's home from the court

179
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,320
to conserve France, forming a community with new development

180
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,549
, jobs and opportunity the ripple effect of a new

181
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:56,519
era begins today. It spreads across the with up

182
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,299
through bronze and across the great state of Wisconsin.

183
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,590
Cycle down Milwaukee Bucks for a start. I don't

184
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,480
think Wisconsin will be transformed by one new arena.

185
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,679
And also, if you really are looking to make

186
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,590
a tangible change, how about coming up with a

187
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,029
better slogan than fear? The deer dears aren't scary

188
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,779
. They're timid forest ponies with sticks on their heads

189
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,240
. I mean, oh, dear. Stadiums very

190
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,009
rarely revitalized their surrounding areas. All create large numbers

191
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,690
of permanent jobs. Just listen to one bar owner

192
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,820
near that new Marlins ballpark, he says, since

193
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,700
the stadium opened in 2012 not only of his profits

194
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,110
not risen on game days, his regular stay away

195
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,649
, afraid of the traffic Here is a business owner

196
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,600
. We don't see any changes that could even say

197
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,480
it's hurting us. Of course it is because no

198
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,919
one has ever said, Hey, let's go hang

199
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:54,740
out in the area around the stadium on. I'll

200
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,440
tell you why I got a new shirt and I

201
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,789
really want someone to vomit Miller Lite and not shows

202
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:01,539
all over. In fact, a major review of

203
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:05,740
almost 20 years of studies showed economists could find no

204
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,590
substantial evidence that stadiums had increased jobs, incomes or

205
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,049
tax revenues. Or to put that another way,

206
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:13,309
this one economist said to me, I love this

207
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:16,759
line. He said, You're rather than spend a

208
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,730
$1,000,000,000 on a stadium. You're actually better off flying

209
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,639
a plane over a city and dumping a$1,000,000,000 on

210
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,159
the populace and just letting them pick up the money

211
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:33,950
and spend it. That is a great idea for

212
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,610
the economy. But it is a fantastic idea for

213
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,389
a new reality show. Tune in this Sunday for

214
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:45,789
Ryan Seacrest's$1,000,000,000 dump only on NBC. And it

215
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,730
gets one step worse because when you use public money

216
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,149
to pay for expensive stadium, you might find yourself

217
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,519
unable to afford something you badly need. Hamilton County

218
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,750
in Ohio was estimated to spend 50 million last year

219
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,299
on debts and other costs for the Bangles on the

220
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:03,539
red stadiums, even though since building them, they've

221
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:05,600
had to sell a public hospital, cut 1700 jobs

222
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,259
and delay payments for schools because of budget gaps.

223
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,779
And it might not even end there because there's a

224
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,590
clause in the contract that states. If 14 other

225
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,350
NFL stadiums have something then taxpayers must by the Bengals

226
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,980
, that thing on here is how comprehensive that closes

227
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:24,990
. Taxpayers are also on the hook for all kinds

228
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,330
of future bells and whistles, some that haven't even

229
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,740
been invented yet. At some point, taxpayers have

230
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,669
also agreed to pay for a holograph replay machine someday

231
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:41,779
. It's true the Bengals have a deal whereby if

232
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:45,139
someone invents holographic instant replay in the future, the

233
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,350
county has to buy it for them. And that's

234
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,669
the kind of clause owners put into a deal in

235
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:52,690
order to take it out during negotiations. Which begs

236
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,850
the question. What else was in there way?

237
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,830
Want a hell apart? A submarine dock and a

238
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,210
monkey named Professor Banana starting out in the locker room

239
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,559
during halftime? Or we're moving the team to L

240
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,090
. I. But teams get these deals because they

241
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,009
know politicians will capitulate and give them whatever they want

242
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,039
. Remember Milwaukee? What just Monday, just this

243
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,840
Monday, their mayor argued for a new stadium deal

244
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,669
he admits is not perfect with this appeal to civic

245
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:20,250
pride. I was in China 10 years ago.

246
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,919
I was on the Great Wall of China, and

247
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,870
I had a Milwaukee T shirt on and on the

248
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,529
Great Wall of China. This guy Chinese guy came

249
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:31,230
up to me, said Milwaukee Bucks. That's important

250
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,789
to me. It's important to all of us.

251
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,299
Okay, okay. The only possible way that story

252
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:41,029
is true is if that Chinese man happened to be

253
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:46,419
former Milwaukee box player Easy and Alien Milwaukee Bucks.

254
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:52,610
Two seasons I averaged 8.6 points again box, and

255
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,539
you could almost sympathize, because when politicians do try

256
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,549
to stand up to teams, it can cost them

257
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,769
. Last month, the City Council of Glendale,

258
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:01,960
Arizona, voted to try and get out of an

259
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,840
awful deal with the Coyotes, whose hockey arena was

260
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,789
costing them more than$8 million per year. The

261
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:09,990
mayor held a public hearing, and it did not

262
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,330
go well. I support this team. It's you

263
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,210
that doesn't support any fort in this city, not

264
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,019
football and certainly not hockey. What you're doing is

265
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:26,580
childish. It's pathetic and it's just disrespectful. While

266
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,759
I can see her passion Israel, you don't get

267
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:31,169
to call someone childish when you are the one arguing

268
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,759
for spending millions of public dollars You don't have to

269
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,759
keep a joint slab of ice in Arizona. Just

270
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,970
days after that, protease fans raised money so that

271
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,240
she could taste the mayor for charity. Taser,

272
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,789
Taser, Taser. Go, go! Let me

273
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:50,809
out! Okay, okay, okay. First of

274
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:52,370
all, do you have to say Taser three times

275
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:58,220
before tasting someone? You're not tasting Beetlejuice on Second

276
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:00,620
, no one should want to state him so badly

277
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,279
. They're willing to electrocute an old man for it

278
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:05,019
on Look, I know sports can make people behave

279
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:07,940
irrationally. For instance, somewhere there is a man

280
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,610
with this actual tattoo of Tim Tebow as a center

281
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,049
. That makes no sense. But But we have

282
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,809
to come to our senses and stop signing these deals

283
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:18,730
. And if you think it will, John,

284
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,889
there's no way. It's just too hard. Let

285
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,200
me persuade you to fight back in The only way

286
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,120
that I know works on inspirational halftime speech set to

287
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:37,980
music theme. I need you to join me in

288
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:46,779
the have ourselves on emotional, inspiring talk. So

289
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:48,490
got around. I'm at home. You might want

290
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,740
to take a knee. I know things look bad

291
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,159
. These owners have been humiliating us for decades.

292
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,429
sure way could just give up. We could roll

293
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,940
over and let them do it to us for another

294
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,149
20 years. Way could do that right here.

295
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,990
Two nights. We could decide to fight back.

296
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,159
I'm not saying we shouldn't have giant aquariums in ballparks

297
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,490
full of terrified fish. Off course we should.

298
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:23,169
This is America. If we don't have them,

299
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,379
no one else will. But we should not be

300
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:30,149
using public money to pay for them. Yeah,

301
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:33,000
teams might threaten to leave. That might happen,

302
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:37,629
but I happen to believe that your cities are more

303
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:40,549
than just the teams who happen to play their ST

304
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:41,870
Louis stand up. Stand up. ST Louis on

305
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,850
. Look at me. You're more than just the

306
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,629
ramps. You're more than just a ramps. You're

307
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:52,879
a proud Midwestern metropolis, your home of the ST

308
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,090
Louis Arch. San Diego. You're the second largest

309
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,860
city in California. That's no nothing. That's no

310
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,849
nothing. That's a solid number two on you.

311
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,609
Cincinnati. You're the home of the Rock and Roll

312
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:14,710
Hall of Fame. That's Cleveland. What you that

313
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,769
you're the hometown of astronaut Jim Lovell, Andi Emmy

314
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:21,269
award winning actress Carol Kane. That's Cleveland as well

315
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:22,720
. Shit, I'm sorry. You might have toe

316
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,359
hang onto the Bengals, but for the rest of

317
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,089
you, for the rest of you, I want

318
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,019
you to look deep down inside your heart. I

319
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,890
want you to dig in there. I want you

320
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,740
to find something, and it's gonna seem time.

321
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:37,049
But it's the most powerful thing in the world.

322
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:42,819
And it's the word. No. No. So

323
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:45,700
when a billionaire asks you to buy him a hologram

324
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,049
machine that doesn't exist yet, what are you going

325
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:52,559
to say? That's right. On when when they

326
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,980
ask you for public money without opening their books.

327
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,750
What are you gonna say, Teoh? That's right

328
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,109
. When they ask you if they can keep all

329
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:03,579
the money for calling that arena Smoothie King Center,

330
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,329
what are you gonna say to them? Oh,

331
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:07,509
no, that's right. Because that's a stupid name

332
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,130
for anything, even a smoothie store. So listen

333
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,809
to me, because I want you to get out

334
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:19,849
on the next time a team comes around asking for

335
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,950
a new stadium, I want you to make them

336
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:37,049
pay. What you gonna go, Ugo?
